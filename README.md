# George's Garden Center

This project was created as part of an assignment for the Diploma of Web Development at North Metropolitan TAFE. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the use of Bootstrap 5 and SCSS in building a static website.

## Project Description

George's Garden Center is a fictional website that showcases a variety of gardening products, including plants, tools, fertilizers, and pots. The website features four pages: a home page, a products page, an about page, and a contact page.

The home page includes an overview of the website and highlights some of the featured product categories. The products page displays a variety of gardening products organized by category, with images of each product. The about page provides information about the history and mission of George's Garden Center, while the contact page includes contact information and a contact form for customers to submit inquiries or feedback.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- Bootstrap 5: a popular front-end framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites
- SCSS: a CSS preprocessor that allows for more efficient and modular styling
- HTML
- CSS

## Installation and Usage

To view the website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The website is fully responsive and can be viewed on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The website is structured using Bootstrap components, so changes to the layout and styling can be made by modifying the appropriate Bootstrap classes.
